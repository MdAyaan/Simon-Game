      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>Press any key to START. Simon will give only the first signal.</li>
        <li>
          Repeat Simon's signal. In this game, don't wait for Simon to repeat
          signals!
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue repeating the signals of the previous sequence and increasing
          that sequence by one. Try to reach the longest sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you make an error or take more than the required time as per the
          difficulty to play any signal, you'll hear the "RAZZ" sound. This
          means the GAME is OVER.
        </li>
        <li>To PLAY AGAIN follow above steps.</li>
